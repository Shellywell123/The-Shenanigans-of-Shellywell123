# Basement.sav
One of my ongoing projects has been to make an all-in-one gaming station. By dumping all my owned ROM's and save files across all the gaming consoles my Dad and I have collected over the years (all stored in the basement).

So the games can live on through rhe use of emulators running on a single PC (windows) using LaunchBox as the frontend.

# Recovering save game files
To carry on playing a game, exactly where It was left off the save files are required. Different comsoles have differnet formats and methods of storing these files. Typically the cartridge based consoles will store the game progress on  the cartridge its self (alongside the game ROM). Disc based consoles store the save data in a seperate location to the games files. (older consoles have dedicated memory cards).

I plan to slowly update and improve the notes on this page.

N.B. I found all retroarch cores to convert save file formats. I.e they will need ro be converted back to use with orginal hardware/non retroarch emulators.
